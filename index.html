        <p>For my final project I will be presenting what I would call the top 3 TV shows. They are as follows: Breaking Bad, Attack on Titan, and Better Call Saul. Each show will get get a top 3 scenes section, and will have a review explaining why they earned their place. Each page will also have appropriate navigation.</p>
